    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;"><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></span></p>
    
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>I live and am a homeowner in Perivale. &nbsp;</strong></span></p>
    
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;">I love Perivale. Its combination of natural and Art Deco heritage is probably unique to London. I grew up in West Ealing next door to Perivale and have cherished childhood memories of the area. My grandma took me to the shops on Bilton Road, I played and rode my bike around Horsenden Hill, I went on a school field trip to Perivale Wood and my school sports days were held at Perivale Athletics Track. Six years ago I made the decision to buy a home and settle down in Perivale.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Why I stand apart from the current Labour and Conservative Perivale councillors</strong></span></p>
    
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;">My local roots give me something that none of the current Perivale ward councillors have: a deep sense of belonging and long term stakehold in Perivale.&nbsp;Perivale is part of my personal heritage and I am dedicated to improving life for Perivale residents.</span></p>
    
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>My vision for Perivale is not driven by political ideology but achieving the best for the residents and the local environment.</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;">I made a conscious and determined decision to stand as an independent non party affiliated councillor for Perivale in the 2014 local elections because I care more about the local area and people than I do party politics and because I care more about Perivale than about having a political career.</span></p>
    
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;">I also believe in empowering residents to take control over their area by sharing information and co-ordinating community group action.</span></p>
    
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>I have a track record of dedicated hard work for Perivale</strong></span></p>
    
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    </div>
    
    <ul>
        <li><span style="color: #000000;">I have managed a residential estate and chaired a residents&rsquo; association in Perivale for five years.</span></li>
        <li><span style="color: #000000;">I led the successful resident led campaign to get High Speed Rail (HS2) tunnelled under Perivale.</span></li>
        <li><span style="color: #000000;">I have successfully campaigned to improve street lighting and signage in Perivale Station Car Park</span></li>
        <li><span style="color: #000000;">I am campaigning for significant improvements to night time traffic and speeding on and near Bilton Road. Having obtained a petition of 245 signatures in February 2013 I am now pressurising our current councillors to take action. In the short term I am pushing for the 19 traffic solution priorities 1 and 2 for Bilton Road to be implemented as quickly as possible by Ealing Council&#39;s Highways department. However, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN END TO NIGHT TIME HGV MOVEMENTS ON BILTON ROAD ALTOGETHER.</span></li>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BUSINESS RATES</strong></span> - The shopping parade on Bilton Road in Perivale is the life and soul of the local community - the shops are where local Perivale residents meet and pass the time of day as much as shops in themselves. They are an antidote to the Tescopolisation of the local area. Yet shopkeepers on Bilton Road are struggling - not due to demand, but due to the crippling amount of business rates levied on a parade of shops on a residential road without the facilities of a high street. This cannot go on.&nbsp;</span><strong>I stand shoulder to shoulder with Bilton Road shopkeepers in challenging their business rates, because I stand shoulder to shoulder with Perivale residents.</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p><span style="color: #000000;">Come <strong>May 22nd 2014</strong> make your vote count. There are three councillor seats available for Perivale and I will work with whoever else is elected, because solving local problems and issues and putting Perivale first is far more important to me than party politics.</span></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>THE SELBORNE SOCIETY</strong></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Selborne Society was founded in 1885 to commemorate the 18th Century naturalist</span> <span style="color: #0231f9;"><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_White" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0231f9;">Gilbert White</span></a></strong></span> <span style="color: #000000;">of Selborne&nbsp;in Hampshire. It was originally a national organisation, founded to promote the study of natural history, habitats, ecosystems.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Gilbert White is regarded by many as England&#39;s&nbsp;first ecologist, and one of those who shaped the modern attitude of respect for nature.&nbsp;He said of the earthworm:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#39;Earthworms, though in appearance a small and despicable link in the chain of nature, yet, if lost, would make a lamentable chasm. [...] worms seem to be the great promoters of vegetation, which would proceed but lamely without them...&#39;</em></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">White and</span>&nbsp;<strong><span style="color: #0231f9;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Markwick" target="_blank" title="William Markwick"><span style="color: #0231f9;">William Markwick</span></a></span></strong>&nbsp;<span style="color: #000000;">collected records of the dates of emergence of more than 400 plant and animal species, White recording in Hampshire and Markwick in Sussex&nbsp;between 1768 and 1793. These data, summarised in&nbsp;<em>The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne</em>&nbsp;as the earliest and latest dates for each event over the 25-year period, are among the earliest examples of modern phenology. His 1783&ndash;84 diary corroborates the dramatic climatic impacts of the volcanic &#39;Laki haze&#39; that spread from Iceland with lethal consequences across Europe.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Gilbert White&#39;s biogrpaher Richard Mabey notes the striking the way in which Gilbert White often arranges his sentence structure to echo the physical style of a bird&#39;s flight. So:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>&#39;The white throat&nbsp;uses odd jerks and gesticulations over the tops of hedges and bushes&#39;</em>; and <em>&#39;Woodpeckers&nbsp;fly&nbsp;volatu undosu&nbsp;[in an undulating flight], opening and closing their wings at every stroke, and so are always rising and falling in curves.&#39;</em></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">Today&#39;s Selborne Society Ltd was originally the Brent Valley branch of the national Society, and continues the work of its founders, observing and recording wildlife in suburban west London and managing and conserving</span> <span style="color: #0231f9;"><a href="http://perivalewood.k-hosting.co.uk" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0231f9;">Perivale Wood Local Nature Reserve</span></a></span> <span style="color: #000000;">as the Gilbert White Memorial.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">The name Selborne lives on in Perivale in the nearby residential road Selborne Gardens built in the 1930s and Selborne Primary School, while Gilbert White can be found in the cul-de-sac Gilbert White Close on the adjacent Woodlands residential development.</span></p>

//*Ported from HS2 Campaign*//

<body> 

    <p><span style="color: #000000;">In 2012 I founded North Ealing Against HS2.</span></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p><span style="color: #000000;">Together with a number of other residents from Perivale, Greenford, Northolt, Hanger Lane, North and East Acton, forming North Ealing Against HS2, we campaigned and lobbied at all levels against High Speed Rail 2 plans and for better mitigation for the London Borough of Ealing assuming HS2 were to go ahead. We specifically campaigned for the route of HS2 through the London Borough of Ealing to be put in tunnel instead of an overground route - which would jeopardise 18 bridges including both the west and east bridges forming the Hanger Lane gyratory, many homes, two scout huts, half a dozen schools, and Perivale Wood Nature Reserve.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p><span style="color: #000000;">Our campaign achieved its key objectives on 23 April 2013 when, having resisted our recommendation for 18 months, HS2 Ltd and the Department for Transport finally conceded that a tunneled route under Ealing would cost the same amount of money, take less time to build, and crucially cause far less disruption for local residents, businesses, schools and the environment.</span></p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>HS2 Ltd accordingly recommended to the Secretary of State for Transport that the HS2 route through the London Borough of Ealing be put in a 9km tunnel, linking up the tunnel under Ruislip and the short tunnel between Old Oak Common and North Acton instead of an overground route.</strong></span></p>
    

    <p><span style="color: #000000;">In June 2013 together with Edward Bonnor-Moris, Sheetal Sanghani and a number of other residents of Perivale, I formed the Perivale Festivals Committee. Some older Perivale residents remember the country fair on Horsenden Hill and the carnival parade on Bilton Road. However, while Ealing has a series of summer festivals, and Greenford and Hanwell have annual carnivals there is nothing at present in Perivale.</span></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Perivale Festivals is changing all that!&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p><span style="color: #000000;">The aim of the committee is to reintroduce annual festivals to Perivale, to bring together residents of Perivale of all ages and from all ethnic and cultural backgrounds and to promote Perivale as an area with a strong community and identity and a proud history and future.</span></p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p><span style="color: #000000;">On Sunday 3rd November 2013 Perivale Festivals Committee kicked off with its launch event - a Music and Light Fireworks Festival, timed to coincide with Diwali and Bonfire Night. The night, held at Ealing Central Sports Ground was a huge success, attracting 1,500 people including a great many local residents.&nbsp;</span></p>
